## Objective
I am interested in protein meals in Australia but there doesn't seem to be a lot of information organized at once. So I collected the protein meals as data and organized them with mySQL.
As building a mySQL server, I can easily recognize them with the organised data and I'm planning make some queries for useful information from those.
